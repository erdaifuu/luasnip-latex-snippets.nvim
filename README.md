# luasnip-latex-snippets

A port of [Gilles Castel's](https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets)
snippets for the [LuaSnip Engine](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip).
Based on [iurimateus's luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim](https://github.com/iurimateus/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim).

## Why?

Some of the snippets straight up don't work and it's also missing a lot of snippets I would like to personally add. 

Also, debugging!
